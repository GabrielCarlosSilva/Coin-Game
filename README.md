# Coin-Game
It is a simulation of the "coin game", created for exemplify a mathematic field called "Game theory".

The rules are simple, you have to make a decision: insert the coin or not.
Your opponent makes the same decision
If both choose to insert the coin, they both receive 2 points.
If nobody insert the coin nothing happens.
But, if someone insert the coin and the other player doesn't, the player that doesn't insert the coin wins 3 points and the other loses 1 point.

The rules are simple, but the main question is how much each player trusts the other to make the best decision for both.
